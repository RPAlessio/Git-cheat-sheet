\section{Creating local repository}

Starting from the local machine:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create the folder which is supposed to be the local repository
    \item In the Command Prompt, access the folder created and type \textit{git init}
    \item The folder will become your local repository
\end{itemize}

Starting from a remote repository (GitHub):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Access the folder supposed to have the local repository (there will be another folder inside the first folder)
    \item In the Command Prompt, type \textit{git clone (url/ssh of remote repository)}
    \item The remote repository and its files will be copied into the first folder as a second folder named after the remote repository name
    \item This second folder will already be a local repository, so no need to use \textit{git init}
\end{itemize}

\section{General Commands for Control}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{git status} to check if there are any changes in the files, if the files are being tracked (staged) and if there are changes to be committed. It also provides info on which branch one is working on
    \item \textit{git log} to check all commits made in the branch one is working on. One can verify the commit ID
    \item \textit{git log --oneline} to check all commits made in the branch one is working on, but with reduced information - looks nicer and more concise. 
    \item \textit{git diff } shows all the changes made in all files before staging.
    \item \textit{git diff (file name)} shows all the changes made in the specified file before staging.
    \item \textit{git add .} stages (git starts tracking) all changes made in all files
    \item \textit{git add (file name)} stages (git starts tracking) all changes made in the specified file
    \item \textit{git branch} shows all the branches created and highlights (with *) the branch one is currently on
    \item \textit{git rm (file name)} deletes the specified file. Nevertheless, all changes in the file need to be staged and committed before deleting it
    \item \textit{git checkout -- (file name)} deletes the changes made in the file while still in the working directory (before staging) 
    \item \textit{git checkout (branch name)} to start working on the specified branch
    \item \textit{git checkout (commit id)} to "go back" to that specified commit. All other commits made after the specified commit are "unseen". HEAD points to the specified commit
    \item \textit{git checkout (branch name)} to "go back" to the last commit of the specified branch. HEAD points to the last commit of the branch
    \item \textit{git commit -m "reminder message"} to commit the staged changes in files
    \item \textit{git commit -a} to stage and commit changes in files all at once (no need to stage first)
    \item \textit{git checkout -b (branch name)} to create a new branch and change directory to work on the created branch
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Branch, Merge and Rebase}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{git branch (branch name)} to create a branch
\item \textit{git merge (branch name)} to merge the specified branch on to the current branch
\item \textit{git rebase (branch name)} to rebase the current branch according to the specified branch, changing to its history and parenting of commits
\end{itemize}


\section{Push, Pull and Fetch}

In cases which the remote repository was created and cloned to the local repository:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{git push} to push changes from the local repository to the remote repository
    \item \textit{git fetch} to download new files added to the remote repository without updating the history of local repository - mostly used to compared files from local and remote repository
    \item \textit{git pull} to download new files added to the remote repository updating the history of local repository
\end{itemize}


In cases which the local repository was created first and its files must be pushed to the remote repository:


\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{git push origin master} to push changes from the local repository to the remote repository
	\item \textit{git fetch origin master} to download new files added to the remote repository without updating the history of local repository - mostly used to compared files from local and remote repository
	\item \textit{git pull origin master} to download new files added to the remote repository updating the history of local repository
\end{itemize}
